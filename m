Interesting.  I looked at the first few.  I think the nvdimm ones
might be using "if (cleared / 512)" to mean "if (cleared >= 512",
and in that case, the >= might actually be more efficient than the
divide.  On the real-time clock one it looked like a similar usage.
Regardless, it's not a typical idiom so I don't think it's
straightforward to understand.

And you're right, I saw at least one example that looked like
it was using divide when modulo was intended.

It's not trivial to understand the intent where this occurs
either.  Maybe that's what you mean by "mind bending".

I'm glad to have helped identify this case.  I hope it leads
to a few things getting fixed (or improving).
