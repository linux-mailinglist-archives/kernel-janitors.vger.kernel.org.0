The script I use is in the kernel repository at
scripts/checkkconfigsymbol.py. I have not written the script, though.

I know its shortcomings, and I would have written it differently but I
have not spent time improving anything in that script above.

Instead, when I started, I used some kind of bash filtering on the
output. Then, I also have a collected list of known false positives,
as I sent out patches and got responses from developers and
maintainers on the mailing list. And finally, I currently often only
look at the diff between two runs on linux-next.

On my short list concerning Kconfig clean-up:

There are several directories named configs in arch/. They contain
parts of config files, specific for some hardware, but these files
seem to be not reduced to the essential content of relevance, though.
Now, to make things worse, it seems that when changes to Kconfig
symbols, nobody touches those files, and nobody really maintains them
later on either. At the moment, this adds up to 55,000 LoC in the
repository, and I am pretty sure---once it is understood---what each
single file is really intended for, this can be reduced to probably
around 1,000 LoC or even less.

This may also be picked up by others if they are looking for work.

Lukas
