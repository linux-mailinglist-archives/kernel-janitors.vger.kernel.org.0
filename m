  As I mentioned, the scripts I've been dishing out were written about
15 years ago, they are not elegant or sophisticated, and I haven't
followed whatever happened with the "kernel janitors" effort for about
that long. So this is pretty much a, "Hey, here's some stuff I used to
do for kernel janitorial work, others are welcome to pick up where I
left off."

  I'll add an introductory section to my wiki page as to what inspired
me to start thinking about janitor work, but a lot of it was just
perusing the code, noticing patterns of what could be improved, and
tackling stuff like that one item at a time. What I'm saying is that
no one needs to work on just the stuff I'm putting out there -- use
your imagination and ponder what sorts of things could use cleanup.

  More later.
