 -- v1 ------------------------------------------------------------
 send, 20ms apart, control messages, if error is timeout.

 There is multiple reports of random behaviour of USB HID devices.

 I have mouse that acts sometimes quite randomly, I debugged with
 logs others have published that there is HW timeouts that leave
 device in state that it is errorneus.

 To fix this I introduced retry mechanism in root of USB HID drivers.

 Fix does not slow down operations at all if there is no -ETIMEDOUT
 got from control message sending. If there is one, then sleep 20ms
 and try again. Retry count is 20 witch translates maximum of 400ms
 before giving up.

 NOTE: This does not sleep anymore then before, if all is golden.

 -- v2 ------------------------------------------------------------

 If there is timeout, then sleep 20ms and try again. Retry count is 20
 witch translates maximum of 400ms before giving up. If the 400ms
 boundary is reached the HW is really bad.

 JUST to be clear:
     This does not make USB HID devices to sleep anymore than
     before, if all is golden.

 Why modify usb-core: No need to modify driver by driver.

 -- v3 ------------------------------------------------------------

 Timeout given is divided by 100, but taken care that it is always
 at least 10ms.

 so total time in common worst-case-scenario is:

  sleep of 20ms + common timeout divided by 100 (50ms) makes
  70ms per loop, 20 loops => 1.4sec .

 -- v4 ------------------------------------------------------------
 No changes in code, just elaborating what is done in v[1,2,3].

 -- v5 ------------------------------------------------------------
 changes in code: what the build robot found:
    drivers/usb/core/message.c: In function 'usb_control_msg':
 >> drivers/usb/core/message.c:173:11: error: type defaults to
    'int' in declaration of 'timeout_happened' [-Werror=implicit-int]

        static timeout_happened = 0;
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    cc1: some warnings being treated as errors

 -- v6 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Moved and simplified code from usb/core to hid/usbhid/hid-core.

 Made wrapper function to handle actual usb_control_msg() call.

 Timeout is now divided by constant, witch is loop iteration
 count. This way the timeout is kept what user have requested,
 and no additional time is spent.
