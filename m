I think we should go ahead with this.

Initially, I thought we'd need some surgery to cpufeature.c so that
cpus_have_final_cap() could take the _likely_ path for LSE but it looks
like that's only relevant for KVM's AT handling and the common atomic_t
APIs use alternative_has_cap_likely() already.

If we do something similar for PAN, then system_uses_hw_pan() probably
wants the polarity switching from unlikely to likely.
