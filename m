Markus, it's not about imperative tense.  It's about you wasting
people's time.

Read the subject again.  "Allow userspace to provide expected diskseq".
That is imperative tense.  I have not pointed it out to you because it
just doesn't matter at all.  If it's in imperative tense or if it's not
in imperative tense, it doesn't matter.

You're sending out a lot of messages and quite a few times it looks like
your targeting newbies.  One new developer sent me an email privately
who was over the top grateful when I told him he could ignore you.  The
guy was like, "I was so puzzled, because it's my first patch and I
didn't know how to respond."  This was an experienced programmer who we
want, but he was new to the kernel community so he didn't know if we had
bizarre rules or whatever.

I've looked through your patches that have recently been merged.  Some
of those maintainers know that you are banned and that your patches are
not getting any review from the mailing list.  We are really trying to
be nice and to work around your situation.  But don't start bothering
newbies who don't know what the situation is.

regards,
dan carpenter
