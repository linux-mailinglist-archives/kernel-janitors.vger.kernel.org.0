100% untested.  :)  I'll test it tonight.

There are a bunch of ways to write a check like this.  This test is
based on copy and paste, guess work, and instinct.  I normally just
start writing the simplest check I can and test that, then I refine it
based on whatever the common false postives are.

In this code, do I need to have a modification hook?  Probably not, but
it was in the original code I copy and pasted and it seemed harmless.
Slightly ugly perhaps?

I knew from experience that I want to check if it's an explicit NULL
pointer passed to IS_ERR().  There are a few ways to write that.  I
could have looked at the values or I could have looked at the ->possible
values.  I probably should have looked at the values instead...

The __in_fake_assign assignment is copy and paste.  I shoud probably
delete that but it's harmless and a potential speed up.  It was in the
check_check_deref.c and I don't remember why.  Probably it's essential.

I'm not happy with the DEREF_HOOK api.  I've been planning to re-write
that but I haven't yet.

regards,
dan carpenter
