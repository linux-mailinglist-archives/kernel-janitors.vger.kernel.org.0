Patch title looks like better. And I think the main destination of the description is

to tell others what you want to do. If it can, I think it's OK. After all, everyone's style

is different. But I will refer to your suggestions. Thank you!

Sorry, I didn't learn about these. I learn about coccinelle recently by coccinelle scripts in Linux

kernel and coccinelle official website. Now I get more resources. Thank you!


I will give the v2 patch with your suggestions. Thank you!
