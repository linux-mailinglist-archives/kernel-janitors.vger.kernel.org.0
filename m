The difference between this and the KTODO is that the above is bugs that a
bot has discovered, right?

Although I agree that fixing bugs is a great way to learn the kernel, in
some cases people want to create a feature. At least that's a bit more
rewarding.

Currently, while working on adding a feature to the tracing ring buffer,
I've come across several bugs (that I fixed), but also a list of "nice to
haves".

That is, small feature enhancements that make the system better, that I
simply do not have the time to implement. This is where I think KTODO is
useful. If someone wants to add these enhancements, I'd be happy to help
them out (sparingly).
