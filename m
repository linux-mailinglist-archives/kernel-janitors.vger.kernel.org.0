Hi,

I'm quite newbie publicly patching stuff, but at anyway:

For example there is lot of USB HID related oddities reported

by multiple users, that have said that after (kernel) update

of their system USB devices stopped working or work randomly.


I have problem with my mouse, and the problem went away

with my patch. I think that the change to driver by driver is

just code duplication, and with my patch the 'good' HW still

is not going to sleep even that 20ms, the time that I tought

to be good. Max retry time is 400ms.

I'm just beginner,Â  but the MAINTAINERS list mentiones

linus-usb mailing list.

Ok, will do just that.

I try to elaborate bit more.
