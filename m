It is common to get this wrong in general with PHY drivers. Dan
regularly posts fixes like this soon after a PHY driver patch it
merged. I really wish we could somehow get the compiler to warn when
the result from phy_read() is stored into a unsigned type. It would
save Dan a lot of work.

The problem with that is val is supposed to be available to the
caller. I don't know if it is every actually used, but if it is, using
an internal signed variable and then throwing away the sign bit on
return is going to result in similar bugs.

I think the BUILD BUG is a better solution, since it catches all
problems. And at developer compile time, rather than at Dan runs his
static checker time.
