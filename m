Hello,

I'm Francois Petit with Societe Generale Bank here in France. I
sincerely seek to present you as the Next of Kin to a late client who
left behind $145.5 million dollars in a fixed deposit account in my
bank before his demise.

The British born client was into Diamond and Gold mining and died
without a Next of Kin. I shall obtain the legal documents that will
give you legal rights to make this claim legitimately. I am willing to
share the funds 60/40 with you and this shall be completed within 72
hours. With the legal documents, the bank will approve you as the Next
of Kin and pay out this amount to you within three working days. I
considered the funds would be of better use to both of us instead of
letting the bank or some corrupt politician to confiscate the funds.

Kindly get back to me as soon as possible with your full name,
address, direct contact number and occupation for the processing of
the legal documents if you are interested and can be trusted to return
my own share when you have received the funds in your bank account.
More information shall be given to you once I hear from you. I put it
to you that this is probably going to be the best decision you ever
make in your life.

However, if you are not interested in the offer, kindly delete this
message from your mailbox and pretend that I never contacted you. I'll
continue my search for a reliable person that will help out.

Best Wishes,
Francois Petit
