It's very unlikely that the behavior of kfree(NULL) will change.

Nobody will notice the efficiency, and it's not the only goal, code
readability is also important.

Sure. They are properly released in the above example.

Sure, name was not the point. Just that there are now 2 labels.

That's the universal truth :)

Depends on specific code cleanup. But generally, not if the change is only
to add an extra label to skip over kfree() - I will unlikely consider such
patches as useful.
