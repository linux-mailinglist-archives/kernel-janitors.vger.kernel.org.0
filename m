Maybe a good path forward would be to start by flagging extreme cases
only, without being too pedantic ? That assumes we can agree what an
extreme case is.

One thing I found helpful in replies is to add tags just after the
commit message (where the tag will appear when it gets applied), or
after the last comment if I need to comment on something specific. The
recipient will know that they don't need to scroll down after the tag.
