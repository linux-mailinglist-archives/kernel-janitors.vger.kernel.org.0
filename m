Kernel janitors is mostly about fixing and updating kernel API, not
discussing how the kernel works.

You can't write to that sysfs file.
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Mar 17 11:28 /sys/devices/system/cpu/possible
But we do allow people to add and remove CPUs while the system is
running (CPU hotplug).  The number of CPUs is not necessarily fixed at
boot time.  It's not immutable.

I'm not sure if this helps?
