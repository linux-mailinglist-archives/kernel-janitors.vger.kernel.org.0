Yes, usually, the preferred style is to have a error handling path which 
releases all that need to be released.
This is more future proof and usually more readable.

In this particular case, I don't think it would be a good idea because 
there are several different error handling pathd and it would look like 
spaghetti code.

First in your example, acpi_device_bus_id should be set to NULL in the 
declaration of this variable.

But, it is likely that the kfree and kfree_cont are not needed after the 
list_add_tail around line 707.


So, leaving these small pieces of resources freeing where they are now 
looks, IMHO, easier to understand.

But, as you say, it is sometimes a matter of taste, and if someone can 
propose something that is straightforward, it would be welcomed, I guess.
