Well any value of reg->id which doesn't match in the switch statement
will cause a -ENOENT return currently, so a zero size would fail that
way as it stands. So I don't think any size other than u64 is valid in
the current code.

There is obviously a question of return value - perhaps returning
-ENOENT would be more appropriate if the size doesn't match (as a later
kernel could decide to implement registers of different sizes)?
