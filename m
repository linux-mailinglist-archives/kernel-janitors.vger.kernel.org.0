Sorry, that's a misunderstanding

Sorry for my broken English.

by "bare brain",  I means that by using the brains(pure code review) only,

I conjure up this adjective from the word "bare metal".

When I reply you email, I lack a word to describe this.

I believe that many experts have this sort of ability,

they could create a patch by simply give a glimpse of the code.

because they know how does the code run at the very low level.

Sorry Dan,  you are welcomed.

Please withdraw this report.

I don't know why are you angry.

Because our hardware is rare,

Originally, by using the words "bare brain", I means by "pure brain",

I means that you probably without a hardware platform to do verification.

I want to know that if you have tested your patch on the board.

Or, I want to probe that if you have our hardware.

I will consider to send you one if you are long time contributor and if 
you are really interested.

I have a lot of boards, now I'm feel a little bit tired by developing 
drivers for all of them.


Please withdraw that report,  personal attack tend to continues(across) 
to multiple thread.

Sorry for my broken English. I will improve my written skill in the long 
term.

Thanks for you contribution.
