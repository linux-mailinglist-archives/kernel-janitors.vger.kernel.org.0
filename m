Good Day,

Please forgive me if my request is not acceptable by your kind person.

I am Mr. Faustin Amoussou, who works in BOA (BURKINA FASO) as a
non-independent non-executive Director and President of auditting
department, During our last banking audits, we discovered that an
account that belongs to one of our deceased foreign clients, Mr. Wang
Jian, co-founder and co-chair of the HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate
with important real estate properties throughout the USA. he died in
an accident during a business trip in France on Tuesday.

Go to this link:
ttps://observer.com/2018/07/wang-jian-hna-founder-dies-tragic-fall/

I got your contact from a yahoo tourist search while I was searching
for a foreign partner. I am assured of your capability and reliability
to champion this business opportunity when I prayed about you.

I am writing to request your assistance to transfer the sum of
$50,000,000.00 (Fifty million United States dollars) at its counts
as Wang Jian's last foreign business partner, And we will use the fund
to invest in public benefit as follows

1. Establish an orphanage home to help orphaned children.
2. Build a hospital to help the poor.
3. Build an asylum for the elderly and homeless.

Meanwhile, before contacting you, I did an investigation to locate one
of the relatives of the late Mr Jian Wang who knows the account, but I
didn't succeed. However, I took this decision to support orphans and
less privileged children with this fund, because I don't want this
fund transferred to our Account of Government treasury as an unclaimed
fund. I am willing to offer you the 50% of the fund for your support
and assistance to transfer the fund to your account.

More detailed information will be sent to the desegregation explaining
how the fund will be transferred to you Please continue to achieve the
purpose, Reply me on my private E-Mail Address: m_amoussou@aol.com

Waiting for your urgent response.
Attentively
Mr. Faustin Amoussou
