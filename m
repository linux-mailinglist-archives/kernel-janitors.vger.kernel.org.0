That is one way to look at the numbers.
Another is:

  12 - fix about a dozen MUAs to summaries quotes properly
  12000 - fix an unknownable number of people to quote just exactly the
          amount that their particular audience is going to want

and when it comes to fixing-code versus fixing-people, I know which this
community is better at.

I guess there is also the option

   1 - fix vger.kernel.org to reject postings from people who don't
        think and quote like "us", because we already have too many
        contributor and want to block the heretics

This is really just a form of the "platform problem" which lwn.net has
occasionally written about.  The "problem" is that we treat the platform
(library code or other infrastructure) as fixed and develop ugly hacks
in our own code to work around some shortcoming, rather the going into
the platform and fixing it once for everyone there.
