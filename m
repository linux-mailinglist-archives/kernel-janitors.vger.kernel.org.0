No, we are programmers, not MUAs or drivers.  We program the car to
predict and avoid all other road users, no matter where they are.
That project might take a bit longer than fixing MUAs though.

True, and we all use (some version of) English for exactly that reason.
But imagine how it would be if we could all have high quality
translation code built into our MUAs so that anyone in the world could
email us in their own language, and we could each read in our own
language.  That would be awesome.
It would be only slightly less awesome if we could all post with
whichever quoting style works for us, and we could all read emails
seeing whichever quoting style works for us.
Unfortunately we cannot yet translate top-posting to post-posting, but
we *can* translate verbose quoting to terse quoting.
