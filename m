You're right.  But the broken commit is a fix for stable trees, so I was
thinking this fix should also be merged into the stable kernel together.  I
think stable maintainers would do that on their own, but I wanted to make sure
by explicitly Cc-ing them.

Again, you're right.  The uninitialized value can be returned to the caller,
but the caller of the function is not checking the returned value, so no real
problem can occur here.

But I think the unhandling of the return value is a bug itself, that not making
system crash like things but might make user confused, so I was preparing a
followup fix for that, too.  So, though the problem the fixes will fix are not
significant, I'd prefer merging this and the followup fix to stable trees if
ok, since those are anyway bug fix, and should be simple to apply.  If
something conflicts, I will provide backports.


Thanks,
SJ
