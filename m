After hitting "page down" 3 or 4 times and seeing only quoted text, I then
stop and just ignore the email. Yes, there's been emails I purposely
ignored because of this that had asked me to respond near the end. Oh well.
Then they ask, "why didn't you respond?" pointing out the email I was to
respond to. And I would reply, "I never saw the request because of too much
quoted text".

I just replied to an email yesterday that cut too much off, and I had to
make a note about that, and put things back in.

What's worse, is if you are having a technical debate with someone, and
they trim out everything that might go against their argument, but leave
anything that supports their argument. I've seen that happen quite a bit.

I should write a book called "The art of trimming". ;-)
