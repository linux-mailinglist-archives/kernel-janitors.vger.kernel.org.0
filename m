OK, I see your point. Yes, it's good to add one sentence to describe
what the patches does. But I guess this patch is simple enough.

This “optimization” is trivial and does not appear to be related to the
issue this patch is trying to address.

I don’t think this change alone justifies a separate patch, as it would
add review overhead without providing much practical benefit.

-  int i;
-       for (i = 0; i < global.max_units; i++) {
+       for (int i = 0; i < global.max_units; i++) {

Overall, the Intel perf driver largely follows a pre-C99 coding style.
Updating a single instance in isolation does not seem very helpful; if
there is interest, this could be handled as part of a broader,
driver-wide cleanup.

Are you suggesting putting this into a separate patch?
My impression is that the change is simple and closely related, though I
may be missing something. I understand others may see it differently.

Yes, there are some code cleanup/improvement ideas in mind.
