I changed the paragraph to be:

    The snapshot buffer is to mimic the main buffer so that when a snapshot is
    needed, the snapshot and main buffer are swapped. When the snapshot buffer
    is allocated, it is set to the minimal size that the ring buffer may be at
    and still functional. When it is allocated it becomes the same size as the
    main ring buffer, and when the main ring buffer changes in size, the
    snapshot should also change in size if it is allocated.

Thanks!

Agreed. But that's a cleanup for another day. Hmm, maybe that too should be
marked as "KTODO"?

There's a lot of things that we have been discussing on these ring-buffer
patches that could be KTODO items.
