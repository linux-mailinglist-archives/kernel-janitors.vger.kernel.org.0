It's quite common; a set of #defines for every register/function/etc
in their chip, maybe also for every firmware call with a struct
for the interface layout.   Sometimes these are spat our semi automatically
=66rom their hardware group who designed them.
On the plus side, they don't take up any space in the resulting binary,
unlike the zillions of unused wrapper functions some drivers have for
every firmware call/register, many of which aren't used.

I've got a bunch of very hacky scripts that:
  a) Try and find symbols that are unused - generally functions that re
defined but never called;  it's very hacky, but so far I've removed
hundreds of them (and am currently at the end of 'w's  after about 9
months!).
  b) I was also hunting struct's defined in C files and not used, and also
  things like linked lists that are declared/defined but never used.

Generally the patches to remove stuff have been well received, most devs
want dead code removed; there are some who rather like their API the way it
is, even if some of it's not used.   I also try and do things like avoid
hardware definitions (see above) and don't remove one half of a pair
(e.g. if there's an inc_foo and a dec_foo but the inc isn't used).
