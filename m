I'll have politely disagree beyond that the symptoms are indeed about the 
same, the problem is clearly different like you immediately admit even 
yourself by stating this: ;-)

...And that's because "it" actually changed in between so the problem 
became a different one.

This has already been proven incorrect in the context of this patch so 
your argument is rather weak... While reviewing it I clearly noted that 
the different way of handling things was not properly covered, and that 
was because what needs to be "freed" was changed by 
kobject_init_and_add(). If one would have done them separately, each 
commit message would have been more to the point and it would have been 
simpler to review which is exactly the opposite to your claim. But I guess 
we'll end up disagreing on this too :-).

I don't have that strong opinion on this so Harshit please follow what 
Dan is suggesting, just fix the changelog to clearly cover both cases.
