Hi Jakub,

Material is net-next. However I don't understand why it should be
without "Fixes" in such case?

The material going to current release (RC, so I understood: net), should
fix only issues introduced in current merge window. Linus made it clear
several times.

The issue here was introduced long time ago, not in current merge
window, however it is still an issue to fix. It's still a bug which
should have a commit with "Fixes" for all the stable tress and
downstream distros relying on stable kernels. Also for some statistics
on LWN.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
