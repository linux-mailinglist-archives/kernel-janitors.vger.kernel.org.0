Yes, I will give a talk about my exploit for CVE-2021-26708 at Zer0Con and
publish the article next week:
https://zer0con.org/#speaker-section

I'm finishing the article right now.

Yes!

Cool!

I can't say about these two cases, but for CVE-2021-26708 the race window is huge.

To hit the race condition I have two pthreads that work in parallel:
 - 1st pthread calls lock_sock() and performs some work with the virtual socket;
 - 2nd pthread saves the value to a local variable and hangs on lock_sock(),
since the lock is already acquired.

When the first pthread finishes the work and releases the lock, the second
pthread is able to finish lock_sock() and proceed with the out-of-date value in
the local variable.

Maybe this strategy can be used in the cases that you detected.

I would also propose to use your approach and search for access to "protected"
struct fields after UNlock functions.
