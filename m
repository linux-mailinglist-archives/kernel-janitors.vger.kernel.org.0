It is a bunch of lists because mh_handle holds pointers with ref
counters to other structures which are part of lists. :) There is a
list_del() only if hits zero.

That has been changed on dlm/next. There exists a struct mh_handle *
and a dlm_msg * to get rid of void * handles.

Currently if a buffer is allocated it is not possible to free it
again. The allocated buffer of the page will be transmitted
(kernel_sendpage()) out in a contiguous way. If somebody wants to
release memory the page buffer needs to be reordered and it can only
be done before commit().
