Thanks! It's a great piece of advice.

Given that I am not much of a Pro C Developer, I took it up as a
challenge modifying the code in question to use a macro and then a
function. The macro attempt came up reasonably fast but when I tried
switching into a function the ARRAY_SIZE became much of a nightmare...
at least to me with my lacking c skills. But after a while of looking
at the code in question eye to eye, I noticed that the channels and
their size are already saved in the bands (lines 103-105, 110-112 in
drivers/staging/vt6655/channel.c) and that made my life much
simpler... and the resulting code is also simpler. I will give it a go
at sending over the patch and let's see how it goes.
